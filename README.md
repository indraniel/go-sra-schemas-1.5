Autogenerated golang structs for NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA) schema
=======================================================================

This repository contains Go packages to encode/`xml.Unmarshal()` the version
1.5 SRA XML schema formats.  These include the _SRA Study_, _SRA Sample_, _SRA
Experiment_, _SRA Run_, _SRA Analysis_ and _SRA Submission_ definitions.

The code has been autogenerated with the [go-xsd][1] package.  You can **go
get** all the packages or simply fetch a selected subset of them.  In your go
project just type:

    # for all the packages
    go get github.com/indraniel/go-sra-schemas-1.5
    
    # for a single package
    go get github.com/indraniel/go-sra-schemas-1.5/SRA.run.xsd_go

Example Usage
-------------

You will need to define a custom struct in your own code to use these
autogenerated packages.  For example, to use the _SRA Run_ package
you can create a simple program like this:

```Go
package main

import (
	"encoding/xml"
	"fmt"
	srarun "github.com/indraniel/go-sra-schemas-1.5/SRA.run.xsd_go"
)

type SraRun struct {
	XMLName xml.Name `xml:"RUN_SET"`
	srarun.TxsdRunSet
}

func (sr SraRun) String() string {
	xml, err := xml.MarshalIndent(sr, "", "\t")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	return string(xml)
}

func main() {
	data := `
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <RUN_SET xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
          <RUN alias="150949" center_name="WUGSC" run_date="2011-10-18T02:37:00Z" run_center="WUGSC" accession="SRR648183">
            <IDENTIFIERS>
              <PRIMARY_ID>SRR648183</PRIMARY_ID>
              <SECONDARY_ID>SRZ031726</SECONDARY_ID>
              <SUBMITTER_ID namespace="WUGSC">150949</SUBMITTER_ID>
            </IDENTIFIERS>
            <EXPERIMENT_REF accession="SRX216593" refname="150935" refcenter="WUGSC">
              <IDENTIFIERS>
                <PRIMARY_ID>SRX216593</PRIMARY_ID>
                <SUBMITTER_ID namespace="WUGSC">150935</SUBMITTER_ID>
              </IDENTIFIERS>
            </EXPERIMENT_REF>
            <DATA_BLOCK>
              <FILES>
                <FILE filename="116008179.bam" filetype="bam" checksum="92651eb2a910f69d9b7e5aaeab06f278" checksum_method="MD5"/>
              </FILES>
            </DATA_BLOCK>
            <RUN_ATTRIBUTES>
              <RUN_ATTRIBUTE>
                <TAG>assembly</TAG>
                <VALUE>GRCh37-lite</VALUE>
              </RUN_ATTRIBUTE>
            </RUN_ATTRIBUTES>
          </RUN>
        </RUN_SET>
    `

	var sr SraRun
	xml.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &sr)

	// Changing an attribute
	runs := sr.TxsdRunSet.Runs
	runs[0].Title = "The Most Awesome Run Ever"

	fmt.Printf("%v\n", sr)
}
```
The above example used a custom struct called `SraRun`. It specifies two things:

1.  the XML name of the root element in your XML file, as is typical when working with `encoding/xml.Unmarshal()`.
2.  type from the auto-generated package to embed right inside your custom struct.

The second part is the only tricky part. XML Schema Definition has no real
concept of "root element", partly because they're designed to support use-cases
where you embed a full document defined in one XSD deep inside a full document
defined in another XSD. See [go-xsd][1] for more details.

Notice that the the re-rendered XML maybe ordered differently than the
original XML.  This is because the mapping between XML elements and data
structures is inherently flawed: an XML element is an order-dependent
collection of anonymous values, while a data structure is an order-independent
collection of named values.

Updating the Autogenerated Code
-------------------------------

[New defintions and enumeration types get periodically added to the SRA XML
schema.][3]  If you'd like to re-autogenerate the Go code try the following:

Assuming you've [properly setup your GOPATH and GOROOT environment variables][2],
go to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/indraniel/go-sra-schemas-1.5` and do

    $ make prepare
    $ make
    $ make tidy

Please note that that [go-xsd][1]'s `xsd-makepkg` command declares the
autogenerated `structs` in  a different order each time you run it.
This will yield a different ordered re-rendered XML.
